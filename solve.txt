ðŸ§© How to Integrate with Excel Using Macros (VBA)
1. Spreadsheet Layout Suggestion

| Equipment | Hourly Rate | Daily Rate | Weekly Rate | Monthly Rate | Usage Hours (Day 1) | ... | Usage Hours (Day 28) | Invoiced Rate Type | Invoiced Amount |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------------- | --- | -------------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |

2. Logic via Excel Macro (VBA)
The VBA macro would:
Loop through each row (equipment).
Calculate total hours per day/week/month.
Apply the logic:
If usage is â‰¥16 hours in any day â†’ use daily rate.
If usage spans 3+ days in any week â†’ use weekly rate.
If usage spans 3+ weeks â†’ use monthly rate.
If no hourly rate â†’ default to daily rate.
Output the selected rate type and amount in designated columns.

3. Sample VBA Snippet

Sub CalculateInvoicing()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
    
    Dim lastRow As Long
    lastRow = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    Dim i As Long
    For i = 2 To lastRow
        Dim hourly As Double, daily As Double, weekly As Double, monthly As Double
        Dim usageHours(1 To 28) As Double
        Dim totalDaysUsed As Integer, totalWeeksUsed As Integer
        Dim j As Integer, weekUsageDays As Integer
        Dim startCol As Integer: startCol = 6
        
        hourly = ws.Cells(i, 2).Value
        daily = ws.Cells(i, 3).Value
        weekly = ws.Cells(i, 4).Value
        monthly = ws.Cells(i, 5).Value
        
        totalDaysUsed = 0: totalWeeksUsed = 0
        
        ' Loop over 28 days
        For j = 1 To 28
            usageHours(j) = ws.Cells(i, startCol + j - 1).Value
            If usageHours(j) > 0 Then totalDaysUsed = totalDaysUsed + 1
        Next j
        
        totalWeeksUsed = WorksheetFunction.RoundUp(totalDaysUsed / 7, 0)
        
        Dim rateType As String
        Dim invoiceAmount As Double
        
        If totalWeeksUsed >= 3 Then
            rateType = "Monthly"
            invoiceAmount = monthly
        ElseIf totalDaysUsed >= 3 Then
            rateType = "Weekly"
            invoiceAmount = weekly
        Else
            Dim maxHours As Double: maxHours = Application.WorksheetFunction.Max(usageHours)
            If maxHours >= 16 Or hourly = 0 Then
                rateType = "Daily"
                invoiceAmount = daily * totalDaysUsed
            Else
                rateType = "Hourly"
                invoiceAmount = hourly * WorksheetFunction.Sum(usageHours)
            End If
        End If
        
        ws.Cells(i, 35).Value = rateType
        ws.Cells(i, 36).Value = invoiceAmount
    Next i
End Sub
